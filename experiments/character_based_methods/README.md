The purpose here is to compare, for each
character, the networks predicted by different trait-based methods.
The network to compare are unordered and unweighted.

The computations can be run by simply running the following command. Note that it should take a **few minutes**.
```
make
```
This will reproduce the figure used in the article.

The input files ``fitch_input_data.csv`` (Fitch is another name we use for the
``Basic`` method), ``sankoff_input_data.csv`` and ``genesis_input_data.csv``
were extracted from https://github.com/AliLopSan/Genesis-Sankoff/blob/main/notebooks/network_generation.ipynb,
companion repository of https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-94928-9_5.
